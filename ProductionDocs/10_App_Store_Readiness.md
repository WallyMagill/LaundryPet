LAUNDRYTIME - NEVER FORGET LAUNDRY AGAIN

Transform laundry from a chore into a delightful experience. LaundryTime combines practical timer reminders with the nostalgic joy of caring for a virtual pet (think Tamagotchi meets productivity).

🧺 COMPLETE CYCLE TRACKING
Unlike simple timers, LaundryTime tracks your entire laundry flow:
• Wash cycle: Get notified when it's time to move clothes to the dryer
• Dry cycle: Never forget to fold again
• Fold completion: Mark as done and keep your pet happy

🐱 PET-POWERED MOTIVATION
Your virtual pet's happiness depends on completing laundry cycles on time:
• Happy pets = Completed laundry
• Sad pets = Forgotten loads
• Build streaks and track your progress

⏱️ SMART TIMERS THAT WORK
• Customizable wash and dry times (match your machines exactly)
• Background timers that survive app closing
• Reliable push notifications
• Multiple loads? No problem - track several pets simultaneously

✨ KEY FEATURES
• Create multiple pets for different laundry types (colors, delicates, towels)
• Each pet has independent timers and settings
• Health system tracks how recently you've done laundry
• Streak tracking for motivation
• Dark mode support
• No ads, no subscriptions, no data collection

🔒 YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS
• All data stored locally on your device
• No account required
• No tracking or analytics
• No internet connection needed

📱 DESIGNED FOR iOS
• Beautiful, native SwiftUI interface
• Full accessibility support (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
• Optimized for all iPhone sizes
• Minimal battery usage
• Tiny app size (< 20MB)

PERFECT FOR:
• Anyone who forgets laundry in the washer/dryer
• People managing multiple loads
• College students in shared laundry rooms
• Busy parents juggling household tasks
• Anyone who wants to make chores more fun

WHY LAUNDRYTIME?
We built LaundryTime because we kept forgetting wet clothes in the washing machine overnight. Simple timer apps didn't work - we needed something that tracked the complete wash → dry → fold workflow and provided gentle, engaging reminders. The virtual pet adds just enough motivation to build a consistent laundry habit without feeling like work.

Download LaundryTime today and never deal with musty, forgotten laundry again! 🎉
